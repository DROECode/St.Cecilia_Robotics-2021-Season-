# St.Cecilia_Robotics-2021-Season

St. Cecilia Lego Robotics

Community of contributors through GitHub are welcome and appreciated.  

Please post/pull into this repository as with designs, innovations, and or updates to the materials that can be used to improve the studen's enjoyment and understanding of robotics.

This repository was created and is maintained by a father of some great kids and for the St. Cecilia of Beaverton Oregon robotics program.   The coaching staff will evolve over time as will the student participants.   

For the 2021/22 session the CycloneBots 48201 coaching staff consists of:

  - Erika Bayless
  - Wendy Casale
  - Henry
  - Douglas Roe

We work as part of a greater school community where science, technology, engineering, religion, arts, and math (S.T.R.E.A.M).  

We thank the following administrators and faculty as part of our greater STREAM efforts.
  Fr. Cary Reniva
  Lillian Stevens
  Diana Oakley
  Luke Waitrovich

We intend this repository to be an open collection of programming code and session materials to be used as the program progresses.   Our robots are primarily LEGO SPIKE and EV3 robots.   

The coaching staff will manage the overall organization, documentation and maintenance of the repository while the student participants will code the majority of the original programs.   

For each challenge, the team will experiment with ways to program and control the robots using both python and scratch programming through the LEGO Mindstorms interfaces.

We intend to increase our sharing from GitHub into YouTube with copies of our builds, code and challenge solutions.
