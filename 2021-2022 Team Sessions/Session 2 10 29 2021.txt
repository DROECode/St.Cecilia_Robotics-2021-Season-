CYO PRE-SPORT PRAYER

God, as we prepare to compete in this athletic contest, we ask your help and blessing
that we may compete to the best of our abilities and with a true spirit of sportsmanship
so that our efforts give greater glory to You, our Creator. We ask that you protect us
from injury and help us remember that our opponents are our brothers and sisters who are
also under your guidance. For this we pray, Amen.

CYO PRE-SPORT STATEMENT

We will respect and support volunteer coaches and youth and adult referees by remaining
in the designated spectator areas. We will remember that youth participate for their enjoyment,
not ours. We will be good role models by treating everyone in the competition with respect.
We will not make derogatory comments to athletes, coaches, parents, spectators or officials;
athletes learn best by example. We will teach that teamwork and doing your best are more
important than winning. We will applaud good effort by all competitors. We will encourage
the athletes to improve skills and to be good sports. We will also urge them to play by
the spirit of CYO. We will make the athletes feel like winners, regardless of the outcome.
